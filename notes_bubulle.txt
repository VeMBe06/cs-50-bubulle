Project: Breathing bubble app

    what it is /functionalities:
        web application based on flask/python, could eventually be developped for android to use for myself?
        Shows a bubble that grows and shrinks on the screen
        User can choose most parameters for the breathing practice: 
            - breathe in time
            - breath hold time
            - breathe out time
            - no breath hold time
            - practice duration
        
        Key point for this app (and why I want to make it in the first place) is that you can modify the display
         to have something super minimalistic and dark, to use in dark room before bed to not overexpose the eyes like most apps do
            * the display would be completely dark,with the bubble reduced to a thin, dark gray circle that you would almost not see.
             with an OLED display you would be able tohave most of the screen turned off in this setting.
        Will also have default display which is "normal" 
        
        Extra features:
            - add ambient music/sounds
            - add other display colors 
            - make the bubble actually nice? 
            




    What it does:
        //


    How it works:
        Use flask + python for the backend
        Use html/css for the frontend
        the actual animation is handled by the css 
        the parameters for the breathing practice are modified via javascript?
